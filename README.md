# Practical Docker

We have a simple Express app that serves a static JSON.

## Requirements

- NodeJS or [nvm](https://nvm.sh)

If you have nvm installed use the `nvm use`Â command to set your Node version to 14.15.0.

## Run

```
npm install
npm start
```

Visit (localhost:3000)[http://localhost:3000].

### Dev

For developing you can use the `watch` command to restart the server automatically when a file changes.

```
npm run watch
```
