# Practical Docker

We have a simple Express app that serves a static JSON.

## Requirements

[nvm](https://nvm.sh) or Node 14.15.0.

If you have nvm installed use the `nvm use` command to set your Node version to 14.15.0.

## Run

```
npm install
npm start
```

Visit (localhost:3000)[http://localhost:3000].
